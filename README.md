## Approach:

I began this project with a very clear idea of what i wanted to build. I designed my wireframes, erds, wrote my user stories and then got to work. Once I got by basic express app up and running deployed to heroku, I followed every user story to a tee. Once I would complete the user stories for a given view, I would do basic styling and get my elements where I wanted them and then move on

## Unsolved Problems:

There are still several minor CSS issues that I need to deal with (button sizes, margins around elements, etc.)

## Version 2: 

In version two:

* User's will be able to update an existing task.

* User's will be able to add timers to their tasks if they need to be completed in a certain amount of time.

* I'd like to have a page that displays every single one of a nurses currently active tasks rather than only be able to display them in a patient-specific way.
